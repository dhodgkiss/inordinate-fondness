# The Anxious Analyst

This blog was created to serve a handful of purposes. First, by posting brief overviews on how to perform certain procedures in R or Python, I hope to not only provide assistance to readers who may be grappling with the same issues, but also to develop a repository of mini-tutorials so that it's easy to refer to different topics for a brief refresher course. I find that it's extremely easy to forget the syntax or capabilities of various coding procedures when you haven't used them for a while, so I hope that having a searchable bank of articles on common programming methods will prove to be a useful reference.

Secondly, I aim to post short articles on interesting investigations that I carry out to provide worked examples of real data analyses. By enabling readers to post comments, I look forward to receiving feedback on how these analyses may be improved or alternative approaches to achieving the same tasks.

## My backstory

I followed a circuitous path before settling on the field of data science. As improbable as it may be seem, I wasn't born with an innate yearning to manipulate data for a living. Instead, I was initially convinced that studying ecology was the secret to eternal happiness. However, with a BSc, MSc, PhD (soon hopefully!) and few exciting options for gainful employment on the horizon, it soon became clear that ecology was not going to sustain a lifetime of unbridled joy for me (as a vocation at least). I probably should have realised this sooner. 

However, during my ecological studies, I found that analysing data proved to be one of the more rewarding aspects of the scientific process. Then one day after hearing me rant about the paucity of reasonably-paid, 9-to-5 ecology jobs out there, a friend of mine told me about how some of his acquaintances had taken part in bootcamps to learn how to code. As data science marries coding with data analysis, I started to consider this as a viable alternative to attempting to forge a stressful career in academia. Thus, the seed was planted in my mind and since then I've been working towards embarking on a career in data science.
